## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Reactions Disclaimer

This app predicts exactly what your parents and relatives are thinking but are too "polite" to say. It includes predictions for:
- **His Family**: Usually worrying about salary gaps and "round rotis."
- **Her Family**: Worrying about joint families and whether you're "settled" enough.
- **The Astrologer**: Who probably just wants another ₹11,000 to "fix" your Mars rage.
